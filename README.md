A discord bot I threw together in a few hours.

## How to self-host:  
Most of the commands are hardcoded so you will have to change those first.
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Install [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py#installing) (Install in a [VirtualEnv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) if you want this seperate from your current environments).
3. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/Lazr1026/keybot`) and enter it (`cd keybot`).
4. Run `python3 main.py`.

## What can it do?
ATM it can only do basic stuff (ie. ban), but a "purge" command is planned.

## Can I help?
Of course! Pull Requests are open to anyone. If you want to report a bug, you can do so in the [Issues](https://github.com/Lazr1026/keybot/issues) tab.
